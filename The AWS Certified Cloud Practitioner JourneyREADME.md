# The [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Journey]

I’m just an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Engineering. I view myself as a back-end developer who works mainly with Node.js/Express written in TypeScript and spends my spare time researching Java and SpringBoot.
Naturally, I required a platform to launch, develop, test, and distribute the things I create. This was when Amazon Web Services entered my life. I fell in love with AWS’s simplicity and strength and worked with it for over a year before deciding to get certified.
As a student, I believed it was best for me to begin at the very beginning. I was looking for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification.

The Initial Investigation
The first step was to visit Netcom Learning’s AWS Training and Certification, the company that gives out the best in the industry AWS-related certifications.
The Certified Cloud Practitioner is the entry-level credential (or CCP in short). I double-checked the essential information, such as the time frame and cost. In addition, I read the Official Exam Guide.
The test covers the fundamentals of using AWS. According to the test handbook they handed over to me, it verifies your ability to:
Explain the significance of the AWS Cloud. Recognize and describe the AWS shared responsibility model.

Learn about AWS Cloud security best practices.
Understand the pricing, economics, and billing procedures of AWS Cloud.
Describe and position AWS’s essential services, such as compute, network, databases, and storage.
Determine whether AWS services are appropriate for typical use scenarios.

I chose to prepare for it since I was satisfied with everything and knew I had what it took to go through it. Getting Ready
The course mainly addressed how AWS operates. I learned about the infrastructure that underpins AWS and how computing, storage, and other services use. I learned about cloud security and the best approaches to the architect on the cloud. Billing and price, as well as the different support choices, we’re also highly significant sections.

I learned from the training that it is up to you to put in the effort. It certainly taught me a lot. However, it was up to me to put in the effort and learn more about the services The initiative is always yours.
Then there were the practice exams. They were accommodating. They taught me a lot of things. It was not the correct answer that I was interested in. It was the incorrect ones. The ultimate takeaway from the tests was understanding why I was mistaken and clarifying the underlying ideas.
In my initial try, I averaged 83 percent on all of the tests. However, it is unimportant how many points you receive on the examinations as long as you analyze your answers and learn from them. You don’t need to rely on guessing; know your thing, and you’ll be fine.

The Examination
The first step in preparing for the actual exam was to schedule it.
It was a reasonably straightforward procedure. You select your exam, set a period, review, and pay. And your exam has been arranged.

The Repercussions
After you finish your exam, you must complete a brief survey. After that, a screen will indicate to you if you passed or failed.
For the time being, your task is complete. The results were expected to be sent within five business days. But I received them the very following day. I received a certificate saying that I am an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, a score report, and a gleaming badge to display!
